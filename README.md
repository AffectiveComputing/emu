> Emotion Mini Utility - simple API for recognizing human emotions on picture.

This project's goal is to quickly classify 7 basic human emotions (anger, contempt, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, surprise) by picture of a human face. Our main goal is to help in research and treatment of autism, but possible applications of Emu in industry are endless.
